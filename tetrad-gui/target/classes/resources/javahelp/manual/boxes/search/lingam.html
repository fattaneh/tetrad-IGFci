<p> LiNGAM ("Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model") refers to a type of model, but also to this
    particular algorithms. For this algorithm, ICA (Independence Components Analysis) is used
    to figure out a causal order for the variables (acyclicity assumed), and this immediately
    infers a causal DAG structure. This was the first algorithm which was able to infer a DAG
    structure and not a pattern, as conditional independence oracle algorithms do.
